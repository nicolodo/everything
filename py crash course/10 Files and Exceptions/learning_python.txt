atm with python I think I know how to
do loops through lists and dictionaries
and open files to read and write to them
We covered using flags to break out of loops
you can see if a string contains another string in it
Covered classes, their methods attributes inheritance
and breaking up classes to make them more manageable
This is known as "composition"
