Driving to work sucks
therefore make a way to get people straight to work
via bus (direct bus) like a school bus.
This should ideally be cheaper than having a car
And more comfortable also.

How do I do it
find all the places people work and when work starts
find all the people and where they work
match them with map routes and buses to their workplaces
It might not work for everyone but it should reduce the 
amount of cars and need for cars
and hopefully put greater use on buses
It might make car journeys nicer too, given fewer cars.

Make general use store tags like lidl has
which will reduce the amount of work shop workers
have to do.
