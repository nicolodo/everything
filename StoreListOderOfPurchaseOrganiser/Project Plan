I want to make a program that takes in a list of sold items
(doesn't have to be sold items but it would help)
to buy at a physical store
And then using that list orders it in the order
you would purchase those items according to the
physical layout of the store.
Feature: It can either let or not let know whether something
    is sold or not

How it might be done
 - Web scrape supermarkets online pages for items that they sell
    also get their prices, (feature track prices over time)
 - Find out how items are grouped in a store, 
    e.g: milk and cheese may be in aisle 8 for Dairy produce.
 - See how the layout of a store is set, and make a way to 
    use that, for odering groups of items
 - find any (or optimal) path for picking up these items
 - return that as a list
 - let the user see that list
